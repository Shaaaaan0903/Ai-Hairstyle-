# AI HAIRSTYLE RECOMMENDER

Overview
This is an AI-powered web app that helps users find the perfect hairstyle based on their face shape. By simply uploading or capturing a photo, users receive a tailored list of hairstyle suggestions — complete with pictures and names — to communicate their style vision clearly with barbers or stylists.

🔍 How It Works
Upload or Capture Photo:
Users choose to upload a photo or take one using their webcam directly on the website.

Face Shape Detection (AI + MediaPipe):
The app uses MediaPipe's Face Mesh and OpenCV to analyze facial landmarks and determine the user’s face shape (e.g., Round, Oval, Heart, etc.).

Personalized Hairstyle Suggestions:
Based on the detected face shape, the app displays a curated gallery of hairstyle images with names — separately for men and women.

User-Friendly Experience:
The UI includes preview confirmation, clean animations, and subtle design elements to enhance trust and enjoyment.

Save Results:
Users can save the result to their device for sharing with stylists or for future reference.
